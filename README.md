# RTD

This Python program simulates the rolling of a six-sided dice by generating random numbers between 1 and 6. After each roll, the user is prompted to decide whether they want to roll the dice again or stop. The program continues until the user chooses to exit by replying with ‘n’, at which point it thanks the user for playing!
